  "description": "The egg that started Eggstyle.\nA 1996 Toyota Previa DX — base model, rear‑wheel drive, supercharged. This was my very first egg, the one that pulled me into the world of Previas and never let go. I learned so much about the chassis from this van; every bolt, rattle, and quirk taught me something new. The obsession only grew from here, but it all started with this one.",
